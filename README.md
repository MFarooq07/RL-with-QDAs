# Reinforcement Learning(RL)-with-Quality Diversity Algorithns (QDAs)

*NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS COMPLETELY PERSONAL AND IS MEANT FOR SELF-LEARNING AND EXPLORING PURPOSES*

Brainstorming on extending the [Robustness in Diversity: Quality-Diversity Driven Discovery of Agile Soft Robotic Gaits](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10521943) paper by including RL for better optimization when adapting to a new terrain.

## Step 1: Literature Review
Read as much papers relevant to connecting the use of RL in problems using QDAs and make an [annotated bibliography](https://github.com/MFarooq07/RL-with-QDAs/blob/main/Annotated_Bibliography_RL_with_QDAs.pdf) for future reference.
